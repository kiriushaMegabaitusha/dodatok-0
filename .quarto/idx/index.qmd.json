They’re the afterthought that sustains the whole architecture: where the real detail hides once the executive summary has declared victory. I’ve often felt that my own research life exists in a similar zone — between the neat declarations of academic papers and the messy reasoning that produced them.\n\nAppendix 0 (Додаток 0) is where that middle ground becomes public. I’ll record my learning curve here — mistakes included, revisions celebrated. Each post will be a dated fragment of a longer investigation into how institutions think, speak, and store meaning.\n\n## The Territory\n\nExpect essays that meander across formal bureaucracy theory, public policy, and computational linguistics, with detours through document theory and information science.\n\nWhat unites these domains is a single obsession: the grammar of order. How do rules write themselves? How does language become procedure? Why does a form feel safer than a sentence?\n\nIf you’ve ever admired a clean metadata schema or argued about the superiority of one ISO standard over another, welcome home. This is a space for the affectionately pedantic — those who find beauty in controlled vocabularies and despair in unnumbered sections.\n\n## The Method\n\nI intend this not as a publication but as a laboratory. Posts will range from short notes to more formal essays, each tagged with its level of maturity — Draft, Revised, Deprecated. Earlier versions will remain accessible; bureaucracy loves a paper trail, and so do I.\n\nYou’ll also see the interplay between the analogue and the algorithmic: scanned marginalia beside code snippets, PDF fragments beside Markdown text. It’s the aesthetic of version control — not to erase the past, but to understand how thinking evolves through its own paperwork.\n\n## The Invitation\n\nLike any appendix, this one anticipates future amendments. If something resonates or provokes disagreement, you’re invited to annotate. Send a memo, file a note, argue in good faith. Ideas, like forms, improve with revision stamps.\n\n## Closing Statement\n\nAppendix 0 (Додаток 0) begins as an experiment in documenting thought before it hardens into policy, code, or doctrine. It’s a reminder that every system starts as a draft — even the self.\n\nEnd of record.
