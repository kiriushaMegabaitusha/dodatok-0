    "text": "Preamble\nPursuant to the unwritten regulations of intellectual curiosity, this document establishes Додаток 0 — an appendix to no known report, a repository for theories, experiments, and bureaucratic daydreams. The numbering begins at zero because every system deserves a prologue: the space before the first entry, where intentions are still fluid and typos are not yet crimes."

    "section": "The Rationale",
    "text": "The Rationale\nBureaucracies adore appendices. They’re the afterthought that sustains the whole architecture: where the real detail hides once the executive summary has declared victory. I’ve often felt that my own research life exists in a similar zone — between the neat declarations of academic papers and the messy reasoning that produced them.\nДодаток 0 is where that middle ground becomes public. I’ll record my learning curve here — mistakes included, revisions celebrated. Each post will be a dated fragment of a longer investigation into how institutions think, speak, and store meaning."

    "section": "The Territory",
    "text": "The Territory\nExpect essays that meander across formal bureaucracy theory, public policy, and computational linguistics, with detours through document theory and information science.\nWhat unites these domains is a single obsession: the grammar of order. How do rules write themselves? How does language become procedure? Why does a form feel safer than a sentence?\nIf you’ve ever admired a clean metadata schema or argued about the superiority of one ISO standard over another, welcome home. This is a space for the affectionately pedantic — those who find beauty in controlled vocabularies and despair in unnumbered sections."

    "section": "The Method",
    "text": "The Method\nI intend this not as a publication but as a laboratory. Posts will range from short notes to more formal essays, each tagged with its level of maturity — Draft, Revised, Deprecated. Earlier versions will remain accessible; bureaucracy loves a paper trail, and so do I.\nYou’ll also see the interplay between the analogue and the algorithmic: scanned marginalia beside code snippets, PDF fragments beside Markdown text. It’s the aesthetic of version control — not to erase the past, but to understand how thinking evolves through its own paperwork."

    "text": "Closing Statement\nДодаток 0 begins as an experiment in documenting thought before it hardens into policy, code, or doctrine. It’s a reminder that every system starts as a draft — even the self.\nEnd of record. Version 1.0 — Subject to revision.\n\nMade in Ukraine with Love / Зроблено в Україні з любов’ю\nThis appendix is rooted in Kyiv, Ukraine, in a country that knows bureaucracy, resilience, and creativity in equal measure. Every line, every footnote, and every draft is a small act of curiosity sent out into the world from here.\nЦей додаток народився у Києві, в Україні — країні, яка знає бюрократію, стійкість і креативність у рівній мірі. Кожен рядок, кожна примітка та кожна чернетка — це маленький акт допитливості, який відправляється у світ звідси."
