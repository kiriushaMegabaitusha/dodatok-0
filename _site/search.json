    "text": "Document No.: DO0-000\nFiled: 2025-10-22\nClassification: Introductory Memorandum\nAuthor: Kyrylo Yasuda\nSubject: Purpose and Scope of Appendix 0 (Додаток 0)\n\n\nPursuant to the unwritten regulations of intellectual curiosity, this document establishes Appendix 0 — an appendix to no known report, a repository for theories, experiments, and bureaucratic daydreams. The numbering begins at zero because every system deserves a prologue: the space before the first entry, where intentions are still fluid and typos are not yet crimes.\n\n\n\nBureaucracies adore appendices. They’re the afterthought that sustains the whole architecture: where the real detail hides once the executive summary has declared victory. I’ve often felt that my own research life exists in a similar zone — between the neat declarations of academic papers and the messy reasoning that produced them.\nДодаток 0 is where that middle ground becomes public. I’ll record my learning curve here — mistakes included, revisions celebrated. Each post will be a dated fragment of a longer investigation into how institutions think, speak, and store meaning.\n\n\n\nExpect essays that meander across formal bureaucracy theory, public policy, and computational linguistics, with detours through document theory and information science.\nWhat unites these domains is a single obsession: the grammar of order. How do rules write themselves? How does language become procedure? Why does a form feel safer than a sentence?\nIf you’ve ever admired a clean metadata schema or argued about the superiority of one ISO standard over another, welcome home. This is a space for the affectionately pedantic — those who find beauty in controlled vocabularies and despair in unnumbered sections.\n\n\n\nI intend this not as a publication but as a laboratory. Posts will range from short notes to more formal essays, each tagged with its level of maturity — Draft, Revised, Deprecated. Earlier versions will remain accessible; bureaucracy loves a paper trail, and so do I.\nYou’ll also see the interplay between the analogue and the algorithmic: scanned marginalia beside code snippets, PDF fragments beside Markdown text. It’s the aesthetic of version control — not to erase the past, but to understand how thinking evolves through its own paperwork.\n\n\n\nLike any appendix, this one anticipates future amendments. If something resonates or provokes disagreement, you’re invited to annotate. Send a memo, file a note, argue in good faith. Ideas, like forms, improve with revision stamps.\n\n\n\nДодаток 0 begins as an experiment in documenting thought before it hardens into policy, code, or doctrine. It’s a reminder that every system starts as a draft — even the self.\nEnd of record. Version 1.0 — Subject to revision."
